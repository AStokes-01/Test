<div style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen">
<p style="color:white" style="font-family:helvetica">My interest in IT came at a young age, playing Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2. Since then I have been interested in computers and gaming. I have been working in hospitality for 9 years now and I want to change careers to something more enjoyable and viable, I believe that IT is the future of the world and having skills and a career in IT will benefit me greatly. I have a close friend that works in the IT industry as a UX designer, we both have dreams of working together in our own media company building and designing websites and apps for clients. </p>
